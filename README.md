# Helicopter-Prison-Escape
Data analysis of escape attempts by helicopter

This is my first data science project in my DataQuest.io boot camp.

The data used for this project is available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes

I analyzed the dataframe as a list of lists, and determine which years had the most escape attempts, and which country had the most escape attempts.

Starting with the year, I first converted the 'Date' items to contain just the year, then counted attempts per year and plot the results and come to the conclusion that the most attempts per year was 3 attempts (1986, 2001, 2007, 2009).

Next, I created a dictionary for the unique 'Country' values and counted the attempts. Then I plotted the results and determined that France had the most escape attempts(15), followed by the United States (8).
